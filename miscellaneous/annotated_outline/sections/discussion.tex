	\begin{itemize}
		\item Learning--we observe:
			\subitem Some ideas in the learning literature explain well what is happening with regard to management of natural resources.
		\switchcolumn Pick up empirical results and show where explanations of learning excel at explaining a bleak status quo.
		\switchcolumn*
		
			\subitem Stagnation in improving performance measures
			\subitem Complexity as cause of continued failure
			\subitem Observation of individual learning as obscuring factor
			\switchcolumn[0]*
		
		\item The overall trend is concerning--how would learning literature respond?
			\subitem Discussion on prospects from routines view
				\subsubitem Second loop/high-intellect learning
			\subitem Discussion on prospects from reliability/validity	
		\switchcolumn Here, I basically argue that unless the underlying issues are identified by members of the industry/operators, there is very little chance that the status quo changes (bar of course external intervention).
		\switchcolumn*
		
		\item Contrast with other sustainability papers
			\subitem More realistic, encompassing and more pessimistic?
			\subitem No individual, optimistic findings--those are misleading noise?
