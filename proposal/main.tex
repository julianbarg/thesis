%	This dissertation uses two lenses to study pipeline spills in the US. These lenses reveal why, despite continuous efforts and technological innovation, the safety record of the industry has stagnated. From 2000 to 2020, the standardized spill volume of refined petroleum pipelines has stayed constant at about 15 bbl per billion barrel-miles transported. In contrast, from 1980 to 2000, standardized spill volume had about halved. The learning literature suggests that it is commonplace for organizational learning to converge in this fashion at a high level of performance. The first chapter of this dissertation reveals the mechanisms behind this convergence. Because learning occurs only in response to recent problems, organizations and industries do not achieve any more aggregate improvements. The second chapter puts into question this common wisdom from the learning literature, and shows that
