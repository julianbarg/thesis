\abstract{
	From 2000 to 2020, the standardized spill volume of refined petroleum pipelines has stayed constant at about 15 bbl per billion barrel-miles transported. In contrast, from 1980 to 2000, standardized spill volume had about halved. This dissertation researches why pipeline operators in the US keep causing and getting away with pipeline spills. The dissertation uses two lenses, organizational learning and greenwashing. These lenses reveal why, despite continuous efforts by engineers, the safety record of the industry has stagnated. The learning literature suggests that it is commonplace for organizational learning to converge at a high level of performance, as observed in the pipeline industry. Greenwashing is a strategy for organizations to escape negative consequences for poor environmental performance.
	
	The first chapter reveals the mechanisms behind the convergence in organizational learning. The empirical section uses a dataset of 6,147 pipeline spills, and qualitative data on 10 significant pipeline spill. This research reveals that valid learning only occurs in response to the spills that an operator experiences. For a general theory of learning, the empirical findings suggests that learning converges when the organization or system that learns has developed a high degree of complexity. Because of this complexity, learning in response to triggers such as failures is not sufficient anymore for making aggregate improvements. Learning turns into a perpetual game of whack-a-mole.
	
	The second chapter takes an encompassing look at the learning literature and promotes a more universal, new theory on the validity and reliability of learning. When learning goes beyond incremental improvements and touches on fundamental assumptions, organizations or industries can break out of their trajectory. However, many learning outcomes that have been thought of as "breakthroughs" have not led to the promised revolutions in the market. Validity and reliability fill an important gap in the literature of learning: even when learning produces sensible and internally consistent insights, these insights are meaningless if they do not serve for the organization to better understand, predict, and control existing problems, limitations, or bottlenecks--that is, if the knowledge is not valid. And valid knowledge still fails to make an impact if it is not reliable, meaning not shared across the organizational members who are to implement the insights.
	
	Finally, the third chapter discusses how pipeline operators keep in check the backlash for the environmental pollution that they cause. Pipeline operators shield themselves from criticism using new technology. When an operator causes a spill, the operator can point to the latest development in the constant flow of new technology as a remedy for future spills. The third chapter uses the same data on pipeline spills and pipeline networks as the first chapter, and adds text data from operators and industry level actors. I then track empirically how these patterns of greenwashing are diffused in the pipeline industry. This analysis sheds light on the role of industry level actors (such as the American Petroleum Institute) in greenwashing.
