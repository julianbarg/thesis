<p>How does greenwashing play out over time? The greenwashing literature has taken a cross-sectional approach to a problem that is complicated by its time dimension <span class="citation">(Lyon and Montgomery 2015)</span>. An organization may move away from greenwashing, because of associated costs, or in a recoupling process. Or when there are no negative consequences to greenwashing, this may reinforce the greenwashing behavior. One could also imagine a strategy of interspersing greenwashing with effective measures to fend off critics, or offsetting greenwashing with investments in new, unproven technology. In the following, I suggest some hypotheses related to the development of greenwashing over time that are testable in the pipeline industry, and introduce greenwashing in that empirical context.</p>
<p>This article takes a longitudinal approach to greenwashing and draws on data from multiple sources to examine greenwashing in the pipeline industry. (1) The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s (PHMSA) dataset on pipelines operated by American pipeline companies, and the accompanying dataset on pipeline spills. (2) Statements by the pipeline operators on their plans with regard to pipeline safety, taken from their annual reports. (3) News and social media coverage of pipeline operators which calls out greenwashing. (4) Fines levied on pipeline operators by PHMSA. (5) Post spill statements by pipeline operators, that reveal their rational and perceived errors (albeit only ex ante).</p>
<p>The greenwashing literature suggests that under some circumstances, greenwashing can become commonplace. As expectations with regard to sustainability increase, businesses can find that it is cheaper to send the “right” signal and obscure actions rather than to address concerns <span class="citation">(Delmas and Burbano 2011)</span>. In the pipeline industry, greenwashing is rampant. One the one hand, the industry advertises pipelines as a safe way of transporting oil and gas. On the other hand, all pipeline operators regularly experience pipeline spills, with sometimes catastrophic consequences. Common strategies are non-substantive commitments to pipeline safety, adoption of unproven technology to fend off critics and the regulator, and investments that are disguised as safety upgrades. By gaining an overview over the greenwashing behavior in this specific industry, we also gain a starting point for discussing greenwashing on a wider scale (beyond individual companies), and the impact we might expect on a larger scale.</p>
<p>In the empirical section of this article, we put hypotheses regarding the longitudinal development of greenwashing in this industry to the test. Do firms recouple? Does deregulation lead to more greenwashing? Does public attention foster a stronger coupling of rhetorics and action? The context of pipeline safety provides us a with a suitable context to put these hypothesis to the test. If firms generally do not recouple, we would expect greenwashing behavior to sustain over time. To test the effect of deregulation, we can take advantage of regulatory changes in Louisiana and Texas as exogenous shocks. And public attention to the industry came about in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which drew attention to crude oil pipelines more than to refined petroleum and gas pipelines.</p>
<h1 id="greenwashing-in-the-pipeline-industry">Greenwashing in the pipeline industry</h1>
<p>As mentioned above, greenwashing is quite commonplace in the American pipeline industry. The industry carries an aura of engineering: its communication with the outside environment is typically carried out by engineers (e.g., in feasibility studies or environmental impact analyses), and in most industry-wide functions by the American Petroleum Institute whose engineers define standards and explores new technologies for pipeline operators–however, the API also lobbies against climate action. This composition of the industry, with workers (e.g., workers who look to pivot away from rig work or undergrad engineering graduates) and managers at most levels of the organizations, but engineers in charge of communication allows for a decoupling of different parts of the organization, and communication on the basis of “clean” decontextualized engineering such as new, unproven technology.</p>
<p>On the organizational level, operators have a number of strategies at their disposal. The obvious is a stated commitment to pipeline safety without substantiating the action to be taken. In other cases, greenwashing takes a more insidious approach. In these cases engineering will take the service of business primarily, and is used to conceal the real interest. The following are two examples: (1) after a 2010 oil spill that polluted the Kalamazoo River in Michigan, Enbridge invested the money it was obligated to spend on safety in upgrading its pipeline capacity in the area. The process of installing a new line with a larger diameter meant that many of the residents who were affected by the spill once again had their lifes disrupted by construction work in their backyard, sometimes on a very short notice.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>(2) In 2006, in a confidential document that was later leaked, a consulting company on behalf of the TransCanada Corporation made two claims. If the Keystone Pipeline was to be constructed, the operator could, using the latest technology, detect a large spill in as little as 9 minutes, and any spill over 50 barrels would only occur once every seven years <span class="citation">(DNV Consulting 2006)</span>. This claim, which was not testable at the time, convinced the regulator to give the green light for the construction of the pipeline. The pipeline began operation in 2010, and as of 2020 had experienced 5 spills of over 50 barrels,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> including one case where the spill continued for 20 minutes after the affected landowner who had discovered the spill had called in<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The problems of the Keystone Pipeline are symptomatic of spill detection technology: a sensitive system can detect small spills, but will also produce many false positives. Thus the real challenge is actually the far more complex one of managing the safety culture, since personnel can easily become desensitized by frequent false alarms and even safety drills.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
